## What is Open Voice OS?

[![Open Voice OS logo](https://openvoiceos.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ovos-egg.png)](https://openvoiceos.com/)

[Open Voice OS](https://openvoiceos.com/) is a community-driven, open-source voice AI platform for creating custom voice-controlled â€‹interfaces across devices with NLP, a customizable UI, and a focus on privacy and security.

## How does it work with Docker/Podman?

Open Voice OS is a complex piece of software which has several core services. These core services have been split into containers to provide isolation and a micro service approach.

| Container            | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                          |
| `ovos_messagebus`    | Message bus service, the nervous system of OpenVoiceOS                                                                       |
| `ovos_phal`          | PHAL is our Platform/Hardware Abstraction Layer, it completely replaces the concept of hardcoded enclosure from mycroft-core |
| `ovos_phal_admin`    | This service is intended for handling any OS-level interactions requiring escalation of privileges                           |
| `ovos_audio`         | The audio service handles playback and queueing of tracks                                                                    |
| `ovos_listener`      | The speech client is responsible for loading STT, VAD and Wake Word plugins                                                  |
| `ovos_skills`        | The skills service is responsible for loading skills and intent parsers                                                      |
| `ovos_cli`           | Command line for OpenVoiceOS                                                                                                 |
| `ovos_gui_websocket` | Websocket process to handle messages for the OpenVoiceOS GUI                                                                 |

To allow data persistance, Docker/Podman volumes are required which will avoid to download requirements everytime that the the containers are re-created.

| Volume        | Description                                      |
| ---           | ---                                              |
| `ovos_models` | Models downloaded by `precise-lite`              |
| `ovos_vosk`   | Data downloaded by VOSK during the initial boot  |

## Supported architectures and tags

### Architectures

| Architecture | Information                                        |
| ---          | ---                                                |
| `amd64`      | Such as AMD and Intel processors                   |
| `aarch64`    | Such as Raspberry Pi 3/4 64-bit                    |

*These are examples, many other boards use these CPU architectures.*

### Tags

| Tag | Description                                                                      |
| --  | ---                                                                              |
| `dev`/`latest` | Nightly build based on the latest commits applied to the `dev` branch |
| `stable`       | The latest stable version based on release versions                   |

## Requirements

Docker or Podman is of course required and `docker-compose`/`podman-compose` is a nice to have to simplify the whole process by using the `docker-compose.yml` files.

**PulseAudio is a requirement and has to be up and running on the host to expose a socket and a cookie and to allow the containers to use microphone and speakers.**

On modern Linux distribution, Pipewire handles the sound stack on the system, make sure PulseAudio support is enabled within PipeWire.

## How to build these images

The `base` image is the main image for the other images, for example the `messagebus` image requires the `base` image to be build. The `sound-base` image is based on the `base` image as well but it's role is dedicated to images that requires sound capabilities such as `audio`, `listener`, *etc...*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-docker.git
cd ovos-docker
docker buildx build base/ -t smartgic/ovos-base:dev --build-arg BRANCH=dev --no-cache --push
```

Open Voice OS provides two *(2)* different implementations for the bus message:

- `ovos-messagebus` which is a Python implementation
- `ovos-bus-server` which is a C++ implementation *(better performances but lack of configuration)*

Only one implementation can be used at a time.

Ten *(10)* images needs to be build; `ovos-base`, `ovos-listener`, `ovos-skills`, `ovos-cli`, `ovos-messagebus` or `ovos-bus-server`, `ovos-phal`, `ovos-phal-admin`, `ovos-sound-base`, `ovos-audio` and `ovos-gui-websocket`.
