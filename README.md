## How does it work with Docker/Podman?

Open Voice OS is a complex piece of software which has several core services. These core services have been split into containers to provide isolation and a micro service approach.

| Container            | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                          |
| `ovos_messagebus`    | Message bus service, the nervous system of OpenVoiceOS                                                                       |
| `ovos_phal`          | PHAL is our Platform/Hardware Abstraction Layer, it completely replaces the concept of hardcoded enclosure from mycroft-core |
| `ovos_phal_admin`    | This service is intended for handling any OS-level interactions requiring escalation of privileges                           |
| `ovos_audio`         | The audio service handles playback and queueing of tracks                                                                    |
| `ovos_listener`      | The speech client is responsible for loading STT, VAD and Wake Word plugins                                                  |
| `ovos_skills`        | The skills service is responsible for loading skills and intent parsers                                                      |
| `ovos_cli`           | Command line for OpenVoiceOS                                                                                                 |
| `ovos_gui_websocket` | Websocket process to handle messages for the OpenVoiceOS GUI                                                                 |

To allow data persistance, Docker/Podman volumes are required which will avoid to download requirements everytime that the the containers are re-created.

| Volume        | Description                                      |
| ---           | ---                                              |
| `ovos_models` | Models downloaded by `precise-lite`              |
| `ovos_vosk`   | Data downloaded by VOSK during the initial boot  |
